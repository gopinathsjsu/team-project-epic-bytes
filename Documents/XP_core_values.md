# XP Core Values
## Communication
Everyone is part of the team and we communicate on every Monday's, Wednesday's and Friday's of a week. We worked together on everything from requirements to code. We created the best solution possible together.
## Simplicity
We implemented what is needed and asked for, but no more. This had maximized the value created for the investment made to date. We took small simple steps toward our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We created something we are proud of and maintain it long-term for reasonable costs.
## Feedback
We considered every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working application. We demonstrated our application early and often then listen carefully and made any changes needed. We discussed about the project and adapted our process to it, not the other way around.
